* Impact: Improved customer retention by 50%
Full sentence:
The most interesting data science project I have done last year was the project that aims at improving the customer retention by delivering a new feature of our app. The new feature was to predict the estimate time of arrival for shipments.

(Ask the interviewer) Do you want me to provide more context or dive into the details of the project?
